I am part of a growing community of design engineers that see technology's future as more than just bigger and faster for the developed world. You'll find us spread around the world, chasing opportunities to reshape the digital and physical landscape into something simpler and more human. Some of us are motivated by frustration with the piles of meaningless stuff around us. Others by the uncertain future of our planet. This pursuit is necessarily international and interdisciplinary; as a result, our travel diaries and research agendas look scattered even though we're not wandering.

Currently, I am a clean energy entrepreneur working on a 2,000 year old problem in Southeast Asian traditional brick-making. In the developing world, there is no such thing as purely a "technology problem", which means that I employ the tools of ethnography, social enterprise, and IT to understand and affect the sociotechnical processes that result in a red clay brick. I am fascinated by the potential of market forces to solve social and environmental problems as well as the possibilities of appropriate technology.
