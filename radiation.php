<h2>Analysis to bound the contribution of radiative heat transfer to the peformance of an improved cook stove.</h2>


<p>A recent week-long exchange on the <a href="http://bioenergylists.org/">bioenergy mailing list</a> for improved cook stove brought up the question of radiative heat transfer improving the performance of a cook stove. Perhaps, the pronents pondered, by converting the heat available for convective heat transfer into infrared radiation the overall efficiency of a stove could be improved drastically. Some preliminary test results using a forced-air gasifier unit suggested that the effect could be dramatic, realizing a doubling of heat transfer efficiency.</p>

<p>The impressive red glow of the prototype emitter turns out to be misleading. A calculation using basic heat transfer principles shows that the maximum power available by radiation is about 300 watts. Even at 100% efficiency, this accounts for only about 18% of the power required to boil water in the reported time.</p>

<p>In other words, in most cases, it's theoretical impossible that boiling time of a stove could be significantly reduced by optimizing radiative heat transfer.</p>

<p>Since the fundamentals of radiative heat transfer could be useful for future stove design, the following article shows how the above conclusion was reached.</p>

<p>An accompanying spreadsheet includes some additional calculatons (view factor, energy to boil water) and some comments from Crispin during the development of the analysis.</p>
