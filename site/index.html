  <h4>about the title</h4>
  <p>
  <em>not wandering</em> was the title of my undergraduate travel blog. It meant something about a conscientious approach to travel: a flaneur rather than a wander.
  </p>

  <p>
  The mechanical engineer has a privileged look into today's big problems: energy, transportation, built landscape, and climate change. In other words, the design of almost everything around us can be influenced deeply by the mechanical engineer. In the spirt of <em>not wandering</em>, I think we can ask a lot more from the technical artifice that surrounds us. I design and build to demonstrate this point.
