<h4>about the title</h4>
<p>
<em>not wandering</em> was the title of my undergraduate travel blog. It meant something about a conscientious approach to travel: a flaneur rather than a wander. over time, I realized the attitude of <em>not wandering</em> had leaked into other parts of my life.

I am motivated by how humanity relates to technology. I think we can ask a lot more from the technical artifice that surrounds us. I design and build to demonstrate this point.
