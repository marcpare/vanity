  <h2>surfing historical momentum</h2>
  
  <p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303">Titan</a></em>, a Ron Chernow biography, reveals how John D. Rockefeller's work influenced the shape of modern society. It's not an artifact like a bridge or a building that serve as John D. Rockefeller's legacy. Rockefeller...</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>pioneered the use of the scientific method in the industrial corporation: “By the time Rockefeller retired, he had a test laboratory in every refinery and even one on the top floor of 26 Broadway. This was yet another way in which he converted Standard Oil into a prototype of the modern industrial organization, its progress assured by the steady application of science”</li>
    <li>started evidence-based medicine – before the research financed by the Rockefeller Foundation American doctors believed bones were the starting point of all disease (osteopathy) and that extremely dilute solutions of just about anything (homeopathy) could cure just about everything.</li>
    <li>started the philanthropy sector, inventing matching grants in the process</li>
    <li>financed the founding of the University of Chicago</li>
    <li>cured hookworm in the South</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Massive fortunes can be unstable or corrupting. Rockefeller directed the condensed ball of energy that was his fortune into a fantastic release of momentum for philanthropy, medicine, and industry. The thing to appreciate is that the ideas he financed now seem fundamental and obvious. The thing is, before Rockefeller's investment in them, they didn't even exist. Think about curing hookworm: before, people believed that Southerners were inherently lazy.</p> 

  <p>It can be easy to view the present as a random collection of circumstance, quite different from anything that has ever happened before. But in studying history, you realize that most everything arises from a few key events, a few key individuals. Very few concepts in love, war, business, and life are genuinely new, and most movements in society can be traced to a few underlying forces. You can choose to study and surf on ongoing momentum of events like Rockefeller's legacy or maintain ignorance and be pushed and pulled by the waves.</p>
