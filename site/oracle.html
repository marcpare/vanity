  <h2>my personal oracle</h2>

  <p>Maciej Ceglowski (idlewords) is my personal oracle. He doesn't know it, but somehow <a href="http://idlewords.com/">in his writing</a> he hits exactly the ideas I'm wondering about, while bravely warning about the bullshit, hype, and arrogance that can poison the pursuit of them. His <a href="https://static.pinboard.in/xoxo_talk_thoreau.htm">latest piece</a> had so much connection to me that I had to write a bit in reaction to it.</p>

  <p>
    I read <em>Walden</em> before spending the last two years on mechanical engineering work in rural Vietnam. I remember the general impression I had of the book on the first reading. Live simply. Question the assumptions underlying the desire for the things around you. You can make it work in a hut in the woods. Not just make it work: thrive.
    </p>
  
  <p>
    In <em>Walden</em>, I was looking for some guidance as to what it meant to be a technologist with principles. What role does the mechanical engineer, industrial designer, or software developer have to play in the shape and form of the times? How can you structure work to contribute to meaningful progress for society?
  </p>
      
   <p> In Vietnam, I developed a project with the brick-making industry to render the brick production process carbon neutral and environmentally benign while preserving an important source of rural livelihood. Every morning, opening my eyes to the brick walls of my room, I was reminded that there was an opportunity to push an industry away from a highly polluting state to an environmentally beneficial one. Those two years were infused with this feeling that we really were at a technical crossroads, that the work of engineers truly made a difference as to what state society eventually reached.</p>
   
    <p>Looking back, how do I know that the technology would have actually benefitted society?
   </p>
   
    <p>In any industry, a technical improvement may have short term benefit but enable or promote a longer-term, unexpected harm. The oil industry, for example, initially had the quite noble position of providing light to the poorest in the United States via kerosene lamps. When oil became important in industry it was literally seeping out of the ground in the United States. A string of technical innovations from the 1900s to today has landed us in the world of cars, highways, aircraft, urban sprawl, and possible climate change.</p>
          
  <p>The more time that you spend in pursuit of "designing a better world", the more you realize that such a notion isn't really possible. Things in society tend to be connected in many surprising ways.
   </p>
   
  <p>Where does that leave us with the question of whether we should pursue technology work in the name of a better society? It reveals that the question is framed incorrectly. Because it's hopeless to try to predict the impacts of a particular technology step-by-step through society, we need some other sort of thinking to get us through it.</p>

  <p>That's where Maciej's message about Thoreau fits in for me.</p>


<p> If you look carefully through the talk, you see it's littered with contradictions. "Eat the Donuts" drives it home; how are we supposed to take seriously the guy living in the woods that gets babied by his mom and sister?</p>

<p>Yet the message still rings true. It rests on a different sort of thinking. The levels of contradiction arise from the format that Maciej adopted of distilling Thoreau's ideas into a "series of lifehacks". The advice doesn't operate at this level. As he points out, the pursuit of the principled technologist is nuanced, layered, and, most importantly, undocumented. If we try to break it down into a step-by-step process, it doesn't make sense. </p>

<p>  Maciej gives us Thoreau's key to making sense of it:
</p>
 <blockquote> "I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours."
</blockquote>
<p>  This is quite a different process. It suggests that instead of trying to design the right answer from the start, we listen and adjust as we go. It assumes that there is something out there that we can't yet imagine. In order to get at it, all we have to do is "Go outside". This means something more than just to enjoy the sensation of being outdoors. The "outside" is both literal and figurative. Engage with the surprises of the environment, not the nice and neat Tim-Ferris-pattern for the good life. You don't know where your creative work will take you (and the rest of us, for that matter). The best you can do it immerse yourself in the world around you, listening attentively as you build.
