  <h1>not wandering</h1>
  
  <h2>my personal oracle</h2>

  <p>Maciej Ceglowski (idlewords) is my personal oracle. He doesn't know it, but somehow <a href="http://idlewords.com/">in his writing</a> he hits exactly the things I'm wondering about, while bravely warning about the bullshit, hype, and arrogance that can poison the pursuit. His <a href="https://static.pinboard.in/xoxo_talk_thoreau.htm">latest piece</a> had so much connection to me that I had to write a bit in reaction to it.</p>

  <p>I read <em>Walden</em> before spending the last two years on technology work in rural Vietnam, largely to justify my wanderlust. I remember the general impression of the book. Live simply. Question the assumptions underlying the desire for the things around you. You can make it work in a hut in the woods. Not just make it work: thrive. </p>

  <p>At the time, I was working on a senior design project for my Mechanical Engineering degree. I had become fascinated with "appropriate technology", particularly improved cooking stoves for households in developing countries. That work, from the very start, has you thinking through how "technical innovations" of modern society may not actually represent an improvement. 
</p>
  <p>A really simple example to consider is shifting from biomass fuels (like wood) to fossil fuels (like gasoline). Wood comes from trees, which, as they grow, pull CO2 out of the air. The CO2 released from burning wood is only as much as was offset by the growth of the tree. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are a one way street: there is no corresponding process that pulls CO2 out of the air to make fossil fuels. 
</p>
  <p>When oil became important in industry it was literally seeping out of the ground in the United States. There was no consideration about its long term impacts because most people didn't even think it was a worthwhile technology to pursue. A string of technical innovations from the 1900s to today have landed us in the world of cars, highways, aircraft, urban sprawl, and possible climate change.</p>

  <p>Would sticking with wood fuel have prevented the climate trends we see now? Would it have led to a development of cities that was more humane? Who knows? The interesting thing to note is that there really is a different way to go about it, and some things we take as fundamental don't actually have to be that way, except for some circumstance in history.
</p>
 <p> Of further interest is that there are parts of the world that haven't yet made the steps down the technical path that our society has. In Vietnam, I chose to work with the brick-making industry in pursuit of a technology that would have rendered the brick production process carbon neutral and environmentally benign while preserving an important source of rural livelihood. Every morning, opening my eyes to the brick walls of my room, I was reminded that there was an opportunity to push an industry away from a highly polluting state to an environmentally beneficial one. Those two years were infused with this feeling that we really were at a technical crossroads, that the work of engineers truly made a difference as to what state society eventually reached.</p>

 <p> There was a counterpoint, however. You may be thinking it yourself by now: how do you know that you would have actually benefitted society with your technology?
</p>
 <p> In any industry, a technical improvement may have short term benefit but enable or promote a longer-term, unexpected harm. The oil industry, for example, initially had the quite noble position of providing light to the poorest in the United States via kerosene lamps. The more time that you spend in pursuit of "designing a better world", the more you realize that such a notion isn't really possible. Things in society tend to be connected in many surprising ways.
</p>
 <p> I found this out because, besides the do-good inspiration for my work in Vietnam, I was trying to escape the software industry. I've spent most of my life involved with software. The rhetoric of the industry is that it affects everything, people say "software is eating the world". I had my doubts about that idea, and I want to test them. When you're on the back of a motorbike, bumping down the road toward a brick-maker's house, what good will being able to write a computer program do you when you arrive?</p>

  <p>To my surprise, it turns out that if you look closely enough, computer programs do influence you, even that far away. In the countryside, I saw designs of machines that came from online schematics. I saw one particular improved stove design all over the countryside of Vietnam and Cambodia. People had somehow run into the schematics online and tried their hand at building the device themselves. The devices rarely worked. It was easy to imagine how the documentation could be improved to get folks building things that did work. Amazing to think access to this knowledge didn't exist before the internet; these steel machines were the product of the internet.</p>

  <p>The ripples of computer technology were present even in a place as far away as I could find from civilization. If I couldn't escape software there, what did that say about the ability of an individual to predict what impact work on software would have? Anything truly influential is going to ripple far and wide, bouncing off ripples from the rest of society into the sort of unpredictable pattern that you get when you throw a pebble into a turbulent stream.</p>

  <p>So we find ourselves going back and forth on the question of whether work in technology makes the world a better place. Does that mean we shouldn't pursue it at all? The problem with this back and forth is that the question is framed incorrectly. We're trying to construct a step-by-step argument tracing the impacts of technology on society. We know that isn't possible, so we need some other sort of thinking to get us through it.</p>

  <p>That's where I think Maciej's message about Thoreau fits in.</p>

<p>  If you look carefully through the article, you see it's full of contradictions. "Eat the Donuts" really drives it home; how are we supposed to take seriously the guy living in the woods that gets babied by his mom and sister? </p>

<p>  Yet, the message still rings true. Thoreau's ideas are powerful and useful. The levels of contradiction arise more from the format of "series of lifehacks" because the advice doesn't operate at this level. The pursuit of the principled technologist is nuanced, layered, and, most importantly, undocumented. If we try to break it down into a step-by-step process, it doesn't make sense. </p>

<p>  Maciej gives us key to making sense of it:
</p>
 <blockquote> "I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours."
</blockquote>
<p>  This is quite a different process. It suggests that instead of trying to design the right answer from the start, we listen and adjust as we go. It assumes that there is something out there that we can't yet imagine. In order to get at it, all we have to do is "Go outside". This means something more than just to enjoy the sensation of being outdoors. The "outside" is both literal and figurative. Engage with the surprises of the environment, not the nice and neat Tim-Ferris-pattern for the good life. You don't know where your creative work will take you (and the rest of us, for that matter). The best you can do it immerse yourself in the world around you, listening attentively as you build.
