  <h2>Annoying Vacation Buddies</h2>
  <h3>Some notes on <em>Breakfast of Champions</em> and <em>Civilwarland in Bad Decline</em></h3>
  
  <p>George Saunders and Kurt Vonnegut were my annoying companions on a recent trip to a Florida resort. I was settling in to the room and happened on a card that touted the resort's plastic disposal efforts.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>  "Responsible Luxury"
</p> <p> "It is estimated that the world's hotels dispose of over 10 billion pieces of packaging from bath amenities each year. Gilchrist &amp; Soames dispense programs prevent hundreds of thousands of plastic bottles from ending up in a landfill.
</p>
  <p>Please join us on the road to a greener future."</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>  "How nice," I thought. Meanwhile, George Saunders pulls me into the office of the Humane Raccoon Alternatives office.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  "At noon another load of raccoons comes in and Claude takes them out back of the office and executes them with a tire iron. Then he checks for vitals, wearing protective gloves. Then he drags the cage across 209 and initiates burial by dumping the raccoons into the pit that's our little corporate secret."
</p>
<p>  "[The brochures] show glossies of raccoons in the wild, contrasted with glossies of poisoned raccoons in their death throes. You lay that on a housewife with perennially knocked-over trash cans and she breaths a sigh of relief. Then she hires you."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, fine, George, I realize the cherry-picked statistic on the hotel card doesn't necessarily mean the hotel isn't polluting in many other extraordinary ways. Later, I find myself walking past a Florida golf course, decorated by a placid reflecting pool. Looking closely, I realize the water is a strange shade of blue. "Why do they need to dye the water so close to the ocean?" I wonder rhetorically as George snickers in the background.
</p>
<p>One of the reason that George Saunders wormed his way into my mind was that his characters and settings aren't over-the-top, in-your-face. They're about as normal as they come. You'll find yourself at a cheap theme park or boring office building. His characters will react in stupendously normal ways. An assistant at the theme park has to sort out a gang problem by hiring a security guy. A husband's relationship with his wife is disintegrating because of an accident at work but mostly because he is a wimp. A 400 pound office worker gets over-excited about a date with a co-worker. You see almost identical behavior no matter where in the world you are. Underneath, however, Saunders will reveal some hideous reality. The security guy turns out to be a deranged psychopath, for example. The seamless back and forth between the superficial normal actions and the ugly underneath are what make the message so powerful, so easy to imagine in real life.
</p>
  <p>Sometimes Saunders will further emphasize this point by flowing into a sci-fi unreality or paranormal encounter. In a scene with a psychiatrist, the narrator finishes his appointment, and in a deadpan tone notes that "the sessions have done me good. Clive doesn't come into my room at night all hacked up anymore. He comes pretty much whole. He comes in and sits on my bed and around with dead kids from other epochs." The transitions between normal and paranormal in Saunders are so smooth that they seem plausible. Try enjoying your vacation when this line is blurred.</p>

  <p>Vonnegut wasn't any more fun to have around. <em>Breakfast of Champions</em> traces the lives of two characters that eventually meet catastrophically. The plot doesn't matter much, as it's just a frame from which to hang a series of observations about just about everything, sort of as if you were explaining the world to an alien. You wouldn't quite know what to emphasize since the alien doesn't have a point of reference about human society. You end up with a picture of the world that becomes more strange the more you try to explain it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  "They talked about aluminum siding as a technique for making old houses look new again. From a distance, these sheets, which never needed painting, looked like freshly painted wood. The driver wanted to talk about Perma-Stone, too, which was a competitive scheme. It involved plastering the sides of old houses with colored cement, so that, from a distance, they looked as though they were made of stone."
</p></blockquote>

<p>  I looked up from my chair on the beach, chuckling at the short-sightedness of the people that would build with such materials, to see lines of buildings coated in colored cement.</p>

<p>  <em>Breakfast of Champions</em> is littered with one paragraph synopses of the plots of fictional books. The little plots almost always mirror the book itself. Other times, they mirror American society. Also, oddly, they bear a striking resemblance to the shape of most of Saunders' stories: the modern world with the tiniest twist. Here's one that describes rhetoric in the modern business world:</p>

<blockquote>  <p>"Trout sat back and thought about the conversation. He shaped it into a story, which he never got around to writing until he was an old, old man. It was about a planet where the language kept turning into pure music, because the creatures there were so enchanted by sounds. Words became musical notes. Sentences became melodies. They were useless as conveyors of information, because nobody knew what the meanings of words were anymore."</p>
</blockquote>
  <p>It wasn't all bad, though. Saunders and Vonnegut slip you the keys to escaping the demented funhouse of their pictures of reality. Vonnegut, in particular, criticizes a version of himself in the book, if his message wasn't obvious enough. 
</p>
  <blockquote><p>"Eddie Key had begun to store in his mind the names and adventures of ancestors on both his mother's and father's sides of his family when he was only six years old...Eddie Key's familiarity with a teeming past made life much more interesting to him than it was to Dwayne...Eddie Key was afloat in a river of people who were flowing from here to there in time. Dwayne and Trout and I were pebbles at rest."</p>
</blockquote>
 <p> I asked about my family tree over dinner, and the conversation unrolled for an hour as we traced back generations, wondering how the world was when our grandparents and great-grandparents were alive. While Saunders and Vonnegut feed your inner cynic, if you look carefully, you see that there's a way out all along, a way to shatter the artificial crust and get at the humanity underneath. The characters struggle because the world around them is harsh and unsympathetic. The slightest bit of compassion inserted into their stories would turn things around. While Saunders and Vonnegut don't often give their characters the benefit of this treatment, you or I always have the choice.
